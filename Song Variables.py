# Storing attributes about a song in Variables

# First create variables for each of the characteristics that make up a song
title = "Ring of Fire"
artist = "Jonny Cash"  # These variables are strings which can be seen due to the ""
album = "The Best of Johnny Cash"
genre = "Country"
time_in_seconds = 163  # time_in_seconds is an integer
beats_per_minute = 103.5  # beats_per_minute is a float
track_number = "1"  # These variables will appear like integers but are strings
year_released = "1967"

# Now its time to print these variables so we can see them in the console
print(title)
print(artist)
print(album)
print(genre)
print(time_in_seconds)
print(beats_per_minute)
print(track_number)
print(year_released)
"""This shows us the information stored in the variable.
However it is just a random list at this point so it would like better if they were defined"""
print("Title: ", title)

print("Track length (s):  ", time_in_seconds)
print("BPM", beats_per_minute)
